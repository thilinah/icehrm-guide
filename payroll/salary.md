## Defining Employee Salary Details

Using the IceHrm `Payroll -> Salary` section, you can add employees salary details. You need to enter the salary details under this section so when you generate the payroll report, the system will automatically generate and calculate the data.

We have three sections to do this:

* Salary Component Types
* Salary Component
* Employee Salary

### Salary Component Types

First, you can define the Salary Component Types according to your organizations payroll requirements.

Example: If the salary component is Car Allowance, you need to create a salary component type for Allowance.

### Salary Component

Using salary components you can define all the component categories.

Example: For the Allowance Salary Component Type, you can create allowances categories like Car Allowance, Telephone Allowance, Laptop Allowance or Internet Allowance according to your company requirements.
